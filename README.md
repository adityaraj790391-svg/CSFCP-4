The Number Guessing Game is a console-based Python project where the computer secretly chooses a random number from 1 to 100, and the player has to guess it. After every guess, the game provides feedback to help the player reach the correct answer — displaying messages such as “Too high”, “Too low”, or “Correct!”. The game also counts how many attempts the player takes to guess the right number.

To make the interaction smoother, the program handles invalid inputs using try–except, ensuring that the game doesn’t crash if the user enters something other than a number. Once the number is guessed correctly, the game shows the total attempts taken and gives the player the option to play another round or exit. This keeps the player engaged while maintaining simple logic that is easy to understand for beginners.

The project demonstrates basic yet important programming concepts including:

Random number generation

Loops and conditional statements

User input handling

Functions for modular code

Error handling

Although small, this game represents how real programs are developed — with clean code structure, user-friendly interaction, and scope for future improvements such as difficulty levels, high score tracking, and GUI support.
